            With a growing interest in self-sustainability, Mike and Julee - two information technology professionals living and working in the Des Moines metro, decided
            to take their interests a step further. In 2013 they purchased 5.5 acres on which to build and plant a garden and orchard. And they
            would do it mostly with their own two hands (well, four hands). The project has not always been easy, but the goal has always 
            been clear: Create a greener lifestyle, and produce fresher ingredients using less chemicals. Though the couple are big proprieters of both cooking and eating good food, Good Eats Farm & Orchard is now producing more than they can
            eat. Mike and Julee now sell their produce to recoup some of the costs of growing them.
