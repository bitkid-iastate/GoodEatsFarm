# Start Here
  The folks at Good Eats Farm & Orchard where kind enough to give me a paid opportunity to learn the .NET framework by building
  **two** seperate systems for them. One of them uses webforms for a responsive business website and a content management system to go
  with it. The other program is built using Microsoft MVC. It's a business side application to keep track of customers, sales, and other farming information - which
  is mostly for the purpose of tax reporting, getting business tax deductions, and getting USDA tax subsidies. Thank you Good Eats Farm & Orchard!

  # 1. Business Website and CMS
  
  #### What is it? It's a custom business website that an administrator can log into and make changes to content on the site, including: editing text content, changing pictures, and adding "News" to the news page. But that's not nearly all.
  
  It's live now here : [Good Eats Farm & Orchard](http://www.goodeatsfarm.com)
  
  It's hosted with a shared hosting service on IIS and built using .NET 4.6.1, C#, Javascript and JQuery, CSS3, one Google API, and one open source Javascript module
  
  It also utilizes Microsoft SQL Server and a Microsoft email server, all hosted by the same company
  
  ### Deepest Regrets
  
  * Not using the bootstrap framework from the begining. As a result, not much of the website is bootstrapped.
  
  * Not notating better. It was difficult to write good notes on my code while I was learning the framework itself, but I recognize the importance of good notation.
  
  ### Highlights & Features
  
  * Keyword meta, description meta, and fast pages for SEO
  * Social media meta tags for more robust sharing on social networks (Normally, when sharing a website on social media just the URL is posted.
  But this website will automatically share a company logo, name, and description/slogan.)
  * Custom business logos with transparent backgrounds for professional look
  * Website visit counter counts sessions, not page hits. Viewable by authenticated users
  * Homepage image carousel, images can be set with credentials
  * Imagemap combined with an aerial photo of the farm creates an interactive experience between visitors and the different parts of the farm
  * Annoucemenent box front and center, and shows on every page. Authenticated users can set the announcement. It can be turned on and off.
  * "News" page acts like the 'Wall' on Facebook. It allows an authenticated user to post blog style content with text and modal images
  * Text content on "About Us" and "Home" pages are dynamic and can be updated by authenticated user
  * All products in all pages under the "Products" menu are dynamic and can be added to, deleted, and edited by authenticated users
  * Special measures allow e-mails to be sent to from visitors to address of choice while preventing spam by hiding the business e-mail address AND prevents automated bots from using the form by requiring a CAPTCHA turing test
  * Optional sign-up to Good Eats Farm & Orchard mailing list
  * Google API calendar makes it easy for the business to add events to the website, and for visitors to add Good Eats Farm events to their own Google calendars
  * The "Gallery" is touchscreen compatible
  * Favicon for bookmarks
  
  ### Look Forward to
  * A business event countdown clock that can be set and turned on/off by authenticated user
  * Authenticated user ability to change the website's background image
